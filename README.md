Hello my name is Eric, I am 20 years old, I love all kinds of fitness, whether that be outdoor activities, hiking running, going on walks and soccer. On the side I have a vested interest in learning more about investing. I grew up in the bay area and after completing my k-12 I was recommended through a family friend to take a look at coding. I am a software developer with a passion for all things tech related, whether that be the new M2 chip the latest phones, tesla autopilot, etc. Codign has just been the perfect fit for me and through the bootcamp I began to realize my passion for coding. I'm yearning to join a software team where i'll bring great communication, outside the box thinking and technical skills
